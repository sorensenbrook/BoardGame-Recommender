# BoardGame Recommender

## Abstract
##### Our project is creating a user friendly and personal boardgame recommender software. After taking a short survey asking the user what preferences they have for boardgames, our software uses a dataset containing over 286180 boardgames to compare and recommend the top 3 best boardgames according to the users preferences. 

Our model consists out of 3 parts:

- Survey Software 	
	- We want to make software that asks questions about the players' preferences and saves these answers for later use in the recommender system
 
- Recommender System
	- Depending on the player’s given preferences, our software should recommend the top 3 board games to play.
	
- Summarizing
	- In its recommendation, the software should summarize what the game is about and why it recommended it.


We have separated the whole project into 3 phases, in accordance with the tasks (see tasks.md file):

### 1st phase (creating the model):
- Questionnaire	<br>
We want to make software that asks questions about the players' preferences and saves these answers for later use in the recommender system
 
- Detailed Database <br>
Creating detailed database which focus on: name, description, mechanisms of the game, category, rating, playtime, number of players and theme.

- Recommender System <br>
Depending on the player’s given preferences, our software should recommend the top 3 board games to play.

- Summarizing <br>
In its recommendation, the software should summarize what the game is about and why it recommended it in a user friendly way.


### 2nd phase (finetuning our model):
- Optimizing <br>
Check if all code is efficient and if there are enough comments 

- Evaluation <br>
Evaluating our model and discussing its effectiveness. 


### 3rd phase (finalizing the project):
- Write the report <br>
- Create presentation slides & content


## Research Questions

Q1: Is it possible to find the best classification of board games based on these several parameters for each player?

Q2: Using a detailed database, can we make a program that uses the answers from a questionnaire to determine which boardgame is best for the user?
